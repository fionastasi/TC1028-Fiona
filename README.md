# Analysis and Insights
We will analyze the differences between two drivers' styles, focusing on braking, speed, and acceleration. Using telemetry data from the qualifying session, we can identify the key moments that led to  victory or defeat. Additionally, we will compare the qualifying results of the top 5 drivers, examining their times and speeds during their fastest laps.

The engineering behind Formula 1 is fascinating and offers a great way to learn how to implement Python tools.

# Requirements
To carry out this project, you will need to download the Fast F1 library. This library is available in the Python package index, and its usage manual can be found here. We will also use its variants, such as fastf1.plotting.
